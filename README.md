SQL Project Analysis Report

**Overview**
This project aims to analyze order data to determine the median order value for each customer. 
By calculating the median order value, we can gain insights into customer purchasing behavior and identify patterns that can help in making informed business decisions.

**Objectives**
Data Extraction: Retrieve relevant order and order item details from the database.
Median Calculation: Implement a method to compute the median order value for each customer.
Insights Generation: Analyze the results to understand customer purchasing patterns and behaviors.

**Methodology**
Data Extraction
The project involves extracting data from two primary tables:

Orders: Contains information about customer orders.
Order Items: Contains details about items within each order.
Calculating the Median Order Value
To calculate the median order value for each customer, a Common Table Expression (CTE) is used. The process is as follows:

OrderedPrices CTE: This partitions the data by customer_id, orders the prices of order items, and assigns a row number to each item while also calculating the total number of rows per customer.
Medians CTE: This calculates the median price for each customer by taking the average of the middle values in the ordered prices.
Final Selection: The final query selects the customer_id and their respective median_order_value.

**Insights**
The median order value is a robust measure of central tendency, especially in skewed distributions. 
By focusing on the median rather than the mean, we get a better understanding of the typical spending behavior of customers, unaffected by outliers.

**Key Findings**
Customer Spending Patterns: The median order values highlight the typical spending habits of customers, providing a clearer picture of their purchasing power.
Targeted Marketing: Identifying customers with higher median order values can help in creating targeted marketing campaigns and personalized offers.
Business Strategy: Understanding median order values can assist in inventory management, pricing strategies, and improving customer satisfaction.

**Conclusion**
This project successfully demonstrates the use of SQL for extracting and analyzing order data to calculate the median order value for each customer. 
The insights derived from this analysis can significantly contribute to strategic business decisions and enhance customer relationship management.
